# Python Calculator (As first project)

This is my first coding project! I decided to make something simple, so hereâ€™s a basic calculator.

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 0.0.1 | My first working calculator as a starting point |
| 0.0.2 | Used `in` for multiple checks and `else` intead of `elif` at the end with these code is shortened and became more readable i guess? |
