# Python Calculator (As first project)

This is my first coding project! I decided to make something simple, so hereâ€™s a basic calculator.
Also Kerem241 is my other account , forgot changing accounts while uploading.

## Version History

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 0.0.1 | My first working calculator as a starting point |
| 0.0.2 | Used `in` for multiple checks and `else` intead of `elif` at the end with these code is shortened and became more readable i guess? |
| 0.1.0 | Translated to English and changed some codes |
| 0.1.1 | Some bug fixes |
| 0.2.0 | I added a loop (as much as possible) so when it finish with its job it goes back to start and continues (until a wrong input entered) |
| 0.3.0 | I added loop for every command , it looks terrible and also it always goes back to start if a wrong input is entered , yet atleast it does not quit i guess |
| 0.4.0 | Used `while True` for better loop progress |
| 0.5.0 | Added 'Do you want to continue ?' question |
